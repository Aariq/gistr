## Reverse dependencies

I have run R CMD check on the 5 downstream dependencies. Summary at <https://github.com/ropensci/gistr/tree/master/revdep>. None had problems.

This version makes a change to accomodate an upcoming change in git2r, one of our dependencies - as well as a few other minor improvements.

Thanks!
