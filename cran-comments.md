R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.0 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This is a re-submission of a submission yesterday. This submission has 
a fix to the Description entry of the DESCRIPTION file, replacing 
"gistr" with "This package".

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
