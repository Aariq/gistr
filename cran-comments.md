I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at 
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.1.2 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This is a resubmission of the first version of this package to 
go to CRAN. Kurt Hornik requested some changes in the DESCRIPTION file. 

I removed "from R" from the Title field, added links for more information on 
gists to the Description field, and added a missing comma. 

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
