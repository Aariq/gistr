R client for GitHub gists.
}
\details{
gistr allows you to peform actions on gists, including listing, forking,
starring, creating, deleting, updating, etc.

There are two ways to authorise gistr to work with your GitHub account:
\itemize{
\item Generate a personal access token (PAT) at
\url{https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token}
and record it in the \code{GITHUB_PAT} envar.
\item Interactively login into your GitHub account and authorise with OAuth.
}

Using the \code{GITHUB_PAT} is recommended.
